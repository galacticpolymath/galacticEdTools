An [<img src="man/figures/Rlogo.svg" alt="R-stats logo" width="24px" height="auto">](https://www.r-project.org/) package to support K-16 education and scicomm. This code was developed by [Galactic Polymath Education Studio](www.galacticpolymath.com) to solve teaching and visualization challenges associated with our lessons. The functions do a variety of things, from making it easy to generate a dated phylogeny that's ready for biology presentations in minutes to turning any ggplot graph into a fun puzzle by enciphering the graph labels. There's lots more to come!

## Installation

> *Before you start (or if you run into errors), consider updating [R to ver 4.1.0 or better](https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/) and [Rstudio ver 1.4.1717 or better](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The package is not on CRAN yet, but you can install the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/galacticpolymath/galacticEdTools) with:

``` {r, "load-package", results="hide", eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools") #you need devtools to install from github
devtools::install_github("galacticpolymath/galacticEdTools")
#* may have to install a fair number of dependencies/updates (I'll work on streamlining this at some point)

#load it
require(galacticEdTools)
#require(datelife) If you get an error about taxa not being found in any chronograms, try this
```

## Example

The impetus for this package was the need to make a figure showing that the many animals we call "panthers" are actually really distantly related cat species. Our genetic rescue lesson, sponsored by [Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick's lab](http://swfitz.com/), uses the example of the Florida panther as a charismatic application of her research (which mostly uses guppies as a model for understanding how gene flow can save small, highly inbred populations from extinction). The figure below was essential for explaining that 1) black panthers are not a species at all, but the (uncommon) dark morph of either a leopard or jaguar, and 2) that these big cats diverged from Florida panthers (which are actually pumas/cougars/mountain lions) around 16 million years ago.

This type of dated phylogenetic tree should be an essential teaching tool for so many lessons in biology, but it requires a lot of time, programming skill, and know-how to create. Our show_phylo() function makes it possible in just a couple lines of code. It's essentially a convenience wrapper that merges functionality from several R packages: chiefly [taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize), [datelife](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife), [ggtree](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree), [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), [phylopic](https://github.com/sckott/rphylopic),  [WikipediR](https://github.com/Ironholds/WikipediR) & many others. 


``` {r, "read-in-species", results="hide", eval=F}
# I want to show that Florida panthers are highly diverged from leopards and jaguars,
# and are actually (a bit) more closely related to domestic cats
speciesNames <- c("puma","leopard","jaguar","domestic cat")

# Now,let's make a phylogeny for these species. Just declare that these are 
# common names, and showPhylo should make some reasonable assumptions to make a pretty plot,
# and by default add scientific names and the cover pictures from Wikipedia using our 
# getWikiPic() function.
cats<-showPhylo(speciesNames,nameType="common")
```

And with no changes to the plot, here's what it should look like.
``` {r first-catphylo, eval=F}
plot(cats)
```
<img src="man/figures/README-first-catphylo-1.png" width="100%" />

By default, pic="wiki", but we can also use pic="phylopic" to get species silhouettes from the [phyloPics image repository](http://phylopic.org/). You can also supply your own images with pic="cust". Check out the vignette for showPhylo() to learn about more customizations. (not done yet)

``` {r include=F, eval=F}
cats2<-showPhylo(speciesNames,"c",pic="phylopic")
```
``` {r second-catphylo, eval=F}
plot(cats2)
```
<img src="man/figures/README-second-catphylo-1.png" width="100%" />

## Is this package useful to you? There are several ways you can support its continued development.
1. Use it! And tag <img src="man/figures/twitter_logo.png" style="padding-right: 2px" width="16px" alt="twitter logo">[\@galacticPM](https://twitter.com/GalacticPM) & <img src="man/figures/twitter_logo.png" style="padding-right: 2px" width="16px" alt="twitter logo">[\@mattwilkinsbio](https://twitter.com/mattwilkinsbio) in a Tweet showcasing what you made.
2. [Sign up for our mailing list](https://eepurl.com/g_kQ4T) and let G5-16 teachers in your network know about our [free lessons and tools](https://www.galacticpolymath.com).
3. If you're a researcher who needs to do outreach, [hire us](https://www.galacticpolymath.com/hire-us) to make your Broader Impacts an easier lift, with higher production, and greater reach.
4. Help us out! We want to streamline the transfer of knowledge from Academia into K-12 schools by offering unbelievably high quality, interdisciplinary lessons that are free for teachers. As a self-funded startup, we depend on volunteer and friendly contract labor from skilled developers (react.js, HTML, CSS, R, D3), graphic designers, artists, education experts and social media influencers.
