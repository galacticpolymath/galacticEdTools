<!-- badges: end -->

An [<img src="man/figures/Rlogo.svg" alt="R-stats logo" width="24px" height="auto">](https://www.r-project.org/) package to support K-16 education and scicomm. This code was developed by [Galactic Polymath Education Studio](www.galacticpolymath.com) to solve teaching and visualization challenges associated with our lessons. The functions do a variety of things, from making it easy to generate a dated phylogeny that's ready for biology presentations in minutes to turning any ggplot graph into a fun puzzle by enciphering the graph labels. There's lots more to come!

## Installation

> *Before you start (or if you run into errors), consider updating [R to ver 4.1.0 or better](https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/) and [Rstudio ver 1.4.1717 or better](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The package is not on CRAN yet, but you can install the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/galacticpolymath/galacticEdTools) with:

``` {r, "load-package", results="hide", eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools") #you need devtools to install from github
devtools::install_github("galacticpolymath/galacticEdTools")
#* may have to install a fair number of dependencies/updates (I'll work on streamlining this at some point)

#load it
require(galacticEdTools)
#require(datelife) If you get an error about taxa not being found in any chronograms, try this
```

## What you can do with galacticEdTools?

#### Make a dated phylogeny for teaching about evolution in just a line or two with `showPhylo()`

## And a growing number of other things. Check out the [Reference Section](https://galacticpolymath.github.io/galacticEdTools/reference/index.html)



## Is this package useful to you? There are several ways you can support its continued development.
1. Use it! And tag <img src="man/figures/twitter_logo.png" style="padding-right: 2px" width="16px" alt="twitter logo">[\@galacticPM](https://twitter.com/GalacticPM) & <img src="man/figures/twitter_logo.png" style="padding-right: 2px" width="16px" alt="twitter logo">[\@mattwilkinsbio](https://twitter.com/mattwilkinsbio) in a Tweet showcasing what you made.
2. [Sign up for our mailing list](https://eepurl.com/g_kQ4T) and let G5-16 teachers in your network know about our [free lessons and tools](https://www.galacticpolymath.com).
3. If you're a researcher who needs to do outreach, [hire us](https://www.galacticpolymath.com/hire-us) to make your Broader Impacts an easier lift, with higher production, and greater reach.
4. Help us out! We want to streamline the transfer of knowledge from Academia into K-12 schools by offering unbelievably high quality, interdisciplinary lessons that are free for teachers. As a self-funded startup, we depend on volunteer and friendly contract labor from skilled developers (react.js, HTML, CSS, R, D3), graphic designers, artists, education experts and social media influencers.
