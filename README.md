# galacticEdTools
Tools for K-16 education and scicomm, developed to support Galactic Polymath Education Studio's lessons, and made available to everyone. Functions do a variety of things, from making it easy to generate a phylogeny that's ready for biology presentations in minutes to code that turns any ggplot graph into a fun puzzle by enciphering the graph labels. And lots more to come!
