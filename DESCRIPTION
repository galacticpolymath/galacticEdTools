Description: Tools for K-16 education and scicomm, developed to support Galactic Polymath Education Studio's
    lessons, and made available to everyone. Functions do a variety of things, from making it easy to generate a
    phylogeny that's ready for biology presentations in minutes to code that turns any ggplot graph
    into a fun puzzle by enciphering the graph labels. And lots more to come!
